Explore Mars with rovers on [mars-photos](https://mars-photos.com/)! 

This is my pet-project using [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) 

This site created for receiving photos from NASA Mars Rovers - Curiosity, Opportinity, Spirit and Perseverence 
You can find photos for any sol, watch preview and open slider.

In this project I mastered:

* react
* react-create-app
* redux, redux-thunk, react-redux
* react-transition-group, CSSTransition
* swiper


You can run this project locally just do:

* clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/zuba2033/mars-photos.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
* `cd mars-photos`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
