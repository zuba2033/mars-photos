Explore Mars with rovers on [mars-photos](https://mars-photos.com/)! 

This is my pet-project using NASA API

This site created for receiving photos from NASA Mars Rovers - Curiosity, Opportinity, Spirit and Perseverence 
You can find photos for any sol, watch preview and open slider.

In this project I mastered:

*react
*react-create-app
*redux, redux-thunk, react-redux
*react-transition-group, CSSTransition
*swiper


You can run this project locally just do:

*clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/Oodmincheg/movie-db.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
*`cd movie-db`
*`npm install`
*`npm start`
